                                        I also have extensive experience in a range of programming areas, 
                                        including netcode development, game hacking, game engine development, and the implementation of the Entity Component System (ECS). 
                                        My passion for programming has led me to pursue diverse areas of focus, 
                                        from high-performance code optimization to efficient implementation of complex programming systems.`);
